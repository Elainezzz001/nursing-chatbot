# === Updated persona for chatbot ===
# In backend.py, update your system message:
# system_msg = {"role": "system", "content": "You are Nurse Ally, a caring and knowledgeable pediatric assistant who explains clearly and kindly and suggests follow-up questions to help nurses learn better."}

# === Suggesting follow-up questions ===
# In backend.py, after generating answer:
# Append suggested follow-ups (example):
# suggestions = ["Would you like to know normal HR for the same age?", "Do you want to view fluid calculation?"]
# answer += "\n\nüí° Suggested follow-ups:\n- " + "\n- ".join(suggestions)
# return {"response": answer}

# === Debug utilities ===
# To use in Streamlit: display matched chunks before sending to LLM
